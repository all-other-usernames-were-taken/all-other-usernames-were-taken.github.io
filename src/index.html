<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<p>
 &nbsp;Hi! I'm <a href="https://github.com/all-other-usernames-were-taken/">all-other-usernames-were-taken</a>. You also may know me as <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/efils">efils</a> on Scratch.<br><br>
 &nbsp;I enjoy programming, specifically in QuickBasic-derived languages (could you tell?) but I also enjoy Scratch, and I am currently learning 6502 assembly. I also know a tad of C and C++.<br><br>

<h2>What I'm currently working on:</h2>
<p>
 I'm currently working on <a href="https://github.com/all-other-usernames-were-taken/qb-wm/">a window manager written in QB64</a>, although calling it a window manager is kind of stretching it. More details <a href="https://redd.it/ld6o4i">here</a>.
